  <h2>My Early Years in Rome</h2>
  <p>
    I was born in Rome, Italy, one of the most fascinating cities in the world. I spent the first five years of my life surrounded by history, art, and the sound of Italian streets. Rome is not just ancient monuments; it’s a living museum filled with passion and tradition. From the Colosseum to the Vatican, every corner tells a story that connects centuries of culture, architecture, and human creativity.
  </p>
  <p>
    Growing up there taught me to appreciate beauty and diversity. Italians are known for their warmth, their love of food, and their joy in life — values that I still carry with me today.

      <h2>Chișinău</h2>
      <p>
        When I was five, my family moved to Chișinău, the capital of Republic of Moldova, and I lived there until I was nineteen.
        It’s a city that feels peaceful and close to nature, with wide tree-lined streets and friendly people.
        Moldova might be small, but it has a warm heart and a deep cultural identity.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Moldovan culture is a mix of Romanian, Russian, and local traditions — you can feel that blend in the music,
        the language, and especially the food. People love to gather around the table, share <em>placinte</em>
        (traditional pies), and talk for hours. That sense of connection and hospitality taught me a lot about kindness
        and appreciation for simple moments.

      <h2>Swimming</h2>
      <p>
        Swimming has always been more than just a sport for me — it’s a rhythm that connects body and mind.
        I practiced swimming for two years, from the age of fourteen to sixteen, and took part in several
        competitions, achieving my best result with a second-place finish. Each time I dive into the water,
        I feel a calm clarity, as if every stroke washes away the noise of the world. It taught me discipline,
        patience, and the peace that comes from persistence.

    <h2>Baking</h2>
    <p>
      Another passion of mine is baking — something I’ve been doing since I was thirteen.
      I started by taking small pastry courses to learn how to make macarons and cakes, and later turned that hobby
      into a small business, selling homemade cakes to friends and family. Baking gives me the same sense of focus
      that swimming does: it’s a balance of precision and creativity, science and emotion. There’s something deeply
      satisfying in creating something with your own hands that brings joy to others.

      <h2>Dancing</h2>
      <p>
        Dancing has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. I started ballroom dancing when I was five years old
        and continued until I was sixteen. During those years, I participated in many competitions across Moldova, performing
        with my teammates and earning several first-place awards. Ballroom dancing taught me rhythm, confidence, and the beauty
        of expressing emotion through movement. It’s more than a sport — it’s a dialogue between discipline and creativity,
        where every step becomes a story told without words.
